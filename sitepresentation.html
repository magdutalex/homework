              <h2>The Last of Us Part II</h2> <p>Ah, yes. The game with a story so good
              that I’ll never—and I mean, never—play it again. The Last of Us
              Part II hit right in the first few months of the pandemic, which
              meant all of us were already in a not-so-stable mood when we first
              got a chance to catch up with Ellie and Joel again. As a follow-up
              to the famous first title from Naughty Dog, it was daunting,
              reckless, and unexpected. (I won’t spoil anything here, but you
              can check out my review if you’d like to relive some of the
              trauma.) It defied a lot of what made the previous title so good,
              and caused a bit of a riptide in the gaming community. But,
              although it may have isolated some fans who were hoping for more
              of the same, Naughty Dog deserves a lot of credit for having the
              courage to spend some time looking in the mirror and reassessing
              the modern action-adventure genre that the studio itself helped
              create. They wrote a story so challenging, so tortured, that it
              left many of us flat on our backs, afraid to ever press start
              again.</p>

        <h2>Final Fantasy VII Remake</h2> 
        <p>This year we finally got to return to Midgar, 
          and it was glorious. Sure, any game surrounded by this much 
          hype was bound to have criticism heaped on it, but Final 
          Fantasy VII Remake is a masterful reimagining of the title
           that redefined what an RPG could be. It takes the iconic story
            of the original and draws it out, but not in a shallow way. 
            Tetsuya Nomura and Square Enix fleshed out nearly everything
             in this world that could be fleshed out—like so many 
             characters who appeared in FF7 but never got the time
              of day, save for roles as class fillers in the
               party—without making it drag. Remake also introduced an 
               engaging style of action-RPG,
                melding the party balancing system 
                from traditional RPGs with more fluid,
                 flashy combat, and overturning the 
                 turned-based system. It was revelatory as a longtime fan to dive back in and experience so much more of Midgar,
                  all while digesting it in the way the original illustrators wanted our imaginations
                  to see those primitive, blocky 3D characters more than 20 years ago. By no means does the Final Fantasy
                  VII remake replace the original. 
                 It instead does something even better: It creates 
                 what feels like a truly new experience. —C.S.</p>
